                      <p>The remarkable ability of animals, such as mice, cockroaches and spiders, to maneuver through challenging cluttered natural terrain has been a primary inspiration for legged robots. Recent research indicates that body reorientation along pathways of minimal energy is a key factor influencing such locomotion. We propose to extend this idea by hypothesising that soft bodied animals and robots could employ an alternate yet equally effective strategy relying on their distributed body compliance to squeeze through cluttered obstacles. To demonstrate the same, we are developing an origami-based hexapedal robot, Compliant Legged Articulated Robotic Insect (CLARI) with compliant exoskeletal morphology. The robot, fabricated using a multilayer laminate laser micromachining technique, has four independently actuated legs. With the use of specifically developed electronics, the in lab manufactured piezoelectric actuators are controlled to achieve the small scale robotic motion. CLARI is able to passively conform to its environment and move through both horizontally and vertically confined spaces.</p>

                      <p>Robotic imitation of biological evolution is difficult with current technology; technology which often lacks the adaptability of living equivalents. Time is another hurdle, significant biological evolution can take centuries. However, by removing hardware from the evolutionary process, previous work has shown that a simulation of a potential robot can be used to accelerate evolution into hours. Bringing these simulations into reality has shown to be difficult, but again, we can look to the living for inspiration. As biology relies on cells, so can robots, and by creating a palette of modules a larger morphology can be assembled which is greater than the sum of its parts. We are using modular robots with different functionalities, which can be seen as varying cells, to create larger, interesting morphologies which are created from designs generated through simulated evolution, designs discovered without human interaction.</p>

                      <p>Brandon received a double major in biomedical engineering and microelectronics engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology. There, his interests centered around microfluidics and multi-physics processes. After a few internships out west in Oregon, Brandon decided to head out to Colorado for grad school as well as the mountains. Brandon’s research focus is on combining additive manufacturing with microfluidics as well as understanding and applications of thermal bubble-driven micro-pumps for microfluidics. In his free time, Brandon can likely be found swimming, hiking, exploring, and biking around in the nearby mountains (with Flagstaff being his current favorite for a quick evening ride).</p>

                      <p>Robotic materials are materials that tightly combine sensing, actuation, computation and communication. With the advent of advanced robotic material fabrication techniques that produce novel sensing and actuation, there also exists an opportunity to integrate computation and communication to create truly autonomous materials. For computation and communication, robotic materials use low-power edge devices. We integrate computing and communication into these devices, ultimately composing those materials into huge distributed computing platforms that can adapt, predict and learn, much like the human brain. With the slow-down of Moore’s Law in the past decades we assume that high-level high-power algorithms will need a simpler, more lightweight equivalence.</p>

                      <p>Autonomous robots are becoming inevitable parts of our society, operating in various applications from deep-sea exploration to human-shared assembly lines. As they advance to these domains, robots are expected to perform challenging tasks whose specifications are often difficult if not impossible to accurately define. To address this challenge, in this talk, I introduce an approach that focuses on learning a complex task from demonstrations as a formal specification. I formulate this problem as a grammatical inference problem, wherein the task is learned as a probabilistic automaton whose edge probabilities represent demonstrators' preferences. I also show that we can incorporate safety specifications during the learning process and prove that the resulting automaton always respects the safety property. I discuss the generality of the method and show that it can easily be integrated into any Evidence-Driven State Merging (EDSM)-based automaton learning algorithms. Moreover, I introduce a planning algorithm that produces the most desirable (user-preferred) plan by maximizing the probability of an accepting trace of the automaton. In the case studies, I show that our algorithm learns the true probability distribution accurately while maintaining safety on a variety of mobile robots and manipulators.</p>

                      <p>In the context of multi-agent systems, there is a growing interest to allow for the coordinated and cooperative operation of heterogeneous systems in uncertain environments. For example, a team of air and ground vehicles can vary in their sensing, computing, and communication capabilities, and might have different sets of models and objectives. The question is how to share information in a scalable and modular way, despite this heterogeneity? In this talk I will show how we exploit the conditional independence structure inherent in different robotics problems to develop a family of methods that allow exact and approximate decentralized Bayesian fusion. These can be used to significantly reduce communication and computation costs, allowing scalability in multi-agent heterogeneous systems as will be demonstrated with a multi-target tracking simulation.</p>

                      <p>As humans and robots begin to coexist in work and household environments, pure collision avoidance is insufficient, as human-robot contact is inevitable and, in some situations, desired. Robotic skin has the ability to enable manipulators to anticipate contact and enhance their approximation of the surrounding environment. This presentation will focus on the ability for robot arms to take slight deviations from their original trajectory through velocity reduction and motion restrictions with the use of onboard sensors.

                      <p>Realistic robotic manipulation applications might expect the robot to operate in dense clutter, in the presence of occlusions, or in ungraspable configurations. These applications may result in failure modes for robot operation through traditional grasping. Nonprehensile manipulation (NPM) offers a complementary solution to prehensile (grasping) manipulation by significantly expanding the size (intended as the set of reachable configurations) and dimensionality (intended as the number of degrees of freedom) of the operational space of even the simplest robot manipulator. In other words, NPM can be used to manipulate objects when conventional grasping-based manipulation is infeasible or unnecessary. This talk will demonstrate the utility of NPM through poking, a skill that allows fast object manipulation and expands the size of a manipulator's reachable workspace. This presentation will also highlight the importance of multimodal planning, i.e., combining both NPM and grasping, to yield highly dexterous robot behavior.</p>

                      <p>The need to create more viable soft sensors has been increasing in tandem with the growing interest in soft robots. There are several types of soft sensing methods, like capacitive sensing and self-sensing, that have proven to be useful when controlling certain soft actuators. However, these sensing methods prove to be problematic when paired with electro-hydraulic actuators, like hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators. These issues are only amplified when trying to sense and control the movement of a multi-HASEL system. To address these shortcomings, we developed a magnetic sensing mechanism for folded HASELs to measure the changes in height of the HASEL. The two-part magnetic sensing mechanism is composed of an off-the-shelf magnetometer and a silicone block doped with neo-bonded powder; the magnetometer sits under the folded HASEL and the magnetic block is placed on top.  Our magnetic sensing mechanism achieves a resolution of <0.05mm (<0.1mm for the HASEL height range) and accurately tracks actuator motion at high frequencies, despite changes in ambient temperature and relative humidity. When scaling up to a larger system with six HASEL/sensor units, we were still able to sample sensor data at the maximum 1kHz and successfully control the system to track a desired end effector position in R3. This work demonstrates the first instance of sensing electro-hydraulic deformation using a magnetic sensing mechanism.</p>

                      <p>This work aims to improve human-robot conversational groups, in which a robot is situated in an F-formation with humans. With a naive look, each robot consists of input devices e.g., sensors, cameras, etc. logic and decision making blocks e.g., face detection algorithm, NLP, etc. and output devices e.g., actuators and speakers, etc. These components connect serially. Each component is prone to errors; therefore, each error feeds into the next component and decreases the overall efficiency of the system. For example, if the camera cannot see a person because of being obstructed by an object, then the human detection algorithm cannot detect that person and then the robot won't consider that person in the interaction. These types of errors decrease the efficiency of the system and also negatively impact human-robot interaction. In this work, we propose four systems that aim to help understand human-robot conversational groups better, reason about them, and find the mentioned errors and overcome them. First, we look at the difference between human-human conversational groups and human-robot conversation groups. Second, we propose an algorithm to detect conversational groups (F-formations). Third, we look at how to detect missing people in the conversational groups and validate human-detection algorithms. Last, we propose an algorithm to detect the active speaker based on visual cues and help robots behave normally in conversational groups.</p>

                      <p>Agile, collision-free navigation in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem in autonomous navigation. Often, such solutions rely on a simplified model of the vehicle and/or environment to reduce computational load, however, this can lead to suboptimal vehicle trajectories, particularly in the case of a highly dynamic ground vehicle interacting with terrain containing dense spatial features. In this talk, I propose a MPC-based algorithm which solves the autonomous navigation problem for a ground vehicle via Levenberg-Marqaudt trajectory optimization and simulated trajectory evaluation.</p>
